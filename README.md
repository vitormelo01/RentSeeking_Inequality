# Testing Stiglitz: The Impact of Rent-Seeking on Income Distribution in States and Counties

### Background:

Stiglitz (2012) claims that rent-seeking is one of the major drivers of rising inequality in the United States. He argues that firms can earn higher profits by gaining non-competitive advantages over rivals and potential entrants, which can lead to higher pay for executives and management in sectors with high amounts of rent-seeking. This paper tests the theory presented by Stiglitz.

### Objective:

We test Stiglitz's theory by estimating the effects of rent-seeking on income distribution at the state and county level. This paper offers the first analysis of the impact of rent-seeking at county level. 

### Methods:

We explore county-level panel data from the Census of Employment & Wages and use the percentage of workers employed in legal services and local government as a proxy for rent-seeking based on Murphy et alâ€™s (1991) approach. We then analyze the impact of our rent-seeking proxies on income inequality, while controlling for some potential omitted variables, as well as time and state/county fixed effects.
